----------

Long story sort:

----------
## What I have done:
- connected BME280 sensor to STM32F411EDiscovery
- written library for reading measurements (BME280.c/h)
- connected Virtual Com Port to Output BME280 measurements into console
----------


## TO DOs for next weeks:
- connect OLED display to STM32F411EDiscovery
- learn Real Time Operating System
- rewrite project in RTOS
- connect clock
----------


## What I managed to accomplish:
- connected Nokia 5110 display to STM32F411EDiscovery
- connected RTC DS3132
- written small library for DS3132
- written rudimentall interface for meteostation
----------

## For the final stage:
- connect all the sensors
- make interface more user-friendly and sophisticated
- implement SD logging
- make a decent frame
----------
## Finally ;) final stage:
- connected all the sensors (except CO)
- interface is made totally simple
- implemented SD logging
- packed project in the plastic case
- written .py script for analyzing .csv logs
